The Linux command line for beginners 2

Where you want to pass multiple file

names to a single command, there are some useful shortcuts that can save you lot of typing if the files have similar names. A question mark ("?") can be used to indicate "any single character" within the file name An asterisk ("*") can be used to indicate "zero or more characters

A couple of examples might help, the following commands all do the same thing

cat test_1.txt test_2.txt test_3

cat test_?.txt 

cat test_*

----

cat t*, meaning "concatenate all the files whose names start with a t and are followed by zero or more other characters". Let's use this capability to join all our files together into a single new file, then view it:

cat t* > combined.txt

---

If you do want to append to, rather than replace, the content of the files, double up on the greater-than character:

cat t*>> combined.txt 
echo "I've appended a line!" >>combined.txt
cat combined.txt
