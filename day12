lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw

Just like ls but for pci, usb, ...

lspci
Shows PCI devices that are connected to the computer.

lsusb
Shows all the USB devices connected to the system.

lshw
Shows hardware. Might need root status to get the full list. Test it!

lsblk
Used for list devices that can read from or write to by blocks of data.

  
Loadable Kernel Modules
Loadable kernel modules (.ko files) are object files that are used to extend the kernel of the Linux Distribution.
They are used to provide drivers for new hardware like IoT expansion cards that have not been included in the Linux Distribution.

You can inspect the modules using the lsmod or manage them via modprobe commands.

If you need to add a module to your kernel (say a new driver for hardware) or remove it (uninstall a driver) you can use rmmod and modprobe.
# rmmod iwlwifi
  
And this is for installing the modules:
# insmod kernel/drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi.ko

But nobody uses insmod because it does not understand dependencies and you need to give it the whole path to the module file.
Instead, use the modprobe command:
# modprobe iwlwifi

you can use -f switch to FORCE rmmod to remove the module even if it is in use
