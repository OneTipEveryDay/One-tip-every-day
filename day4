The Linux command line for beginners 3

in order to see the whole file we now need to use a different program, called a pager (because it displays your file one page" at a time)

These days there's a far better pager that you should use instead: because it replaces more, the programmers decided to call it less.

less combined.txt

When viewing a file through less you can use the Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys to move through your file.

When you've finished viewing your file, press q to quit less and return to the command line.
